Add the Part1 folder to your path (as well as the bitpar folder).
In an empty folder with only the treebank run 
	
	the_new_magic treebank_name number_of_em_iterations

and all sorts of miracles happen! :P For now there's plenty of output 
and weird files and that's why the folder should be preferably empty. 

After all the following files are interesting:

loglikelihoods - loglikelihoods for all iterations
final_scores - shows precision/recall/Fscore for all iterations
all_top_rules - top 10 rules for each iteration
plot_loglikelihoods.png
plot_scors.png
plot_top_rules.png


The rest of the files might show random results from the last iteration made 
(keeping them for test purposes)
